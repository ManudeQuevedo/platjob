# PLATJOB
An internal job vacancies tool for IronHack developed by Ironhackers


## Technical Requirements

### Your app must:

Have at least **3 models** (more if it makes sense) – one representing a User of your application, and two that represent the     main idea of the functionality of your app. Models should be related to each other.
Include sign-up / sign-in / sign-out functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
Have full CRUD routes for at least one of your resources (models).
Utilize Mongoose to create your models and add the proper validations.
Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process.
Have a Responsive Design, we recommend you start mobile-first and then build up for larger screen sizes!
Have semantically clean HTML and CSS.
Be deployed online and accessible to the public.


## Necessary Deliverables


1. User Stories, in **Trello**, following **Kanban**.
2. **Wireframes** of your app as scans/pictures of pen and paper, whiteboarding, or tools such as Sketch for the daring.
3. Project Presentation, done with **slides.com**.
4. A working **full-stack application**, built by you, hosted on **Heroku**.
5. A link to your hosted working application in the URL section of your **GitHub repo**.
6. A **readme.md** file with explanations of the **technologies used**, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
7. A Git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project.


## Suggested Ways to Get Started


* Begin with the end in mind. Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don’t waste time building things you don’t need.
* Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems.
* Read the docs for whatever technologies you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.
* Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application. It’s tempting to just make them todo lists for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it’ll help you know what to build.
* Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something helps.
